## 💡 About 42

> _Learn how to learn._

	42 is a different type of university, no teachers, no classes, only peers and challenges. This repository have some
    of the projects I did during the course. If you are using as reference is ok, but do not copy and paste the code
    otherwise you are not learning 🧐

    All the projects are due using C, no memory leaks are allowed, the code should follow the 42 norm tha is similar to the [NASA](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/dev/code-style.html) one.
